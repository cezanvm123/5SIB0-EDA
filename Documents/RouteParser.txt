For each node with len(dependencyAbove) == 0 (start node) 
     - create a route object
     - add node to place 0 in de list 
     For each node in depedencyBelow
        - add node to route object 
        - if node has a depedencyBelow 
            - Deepcopy route object and call function recursively
